# Dan Greene and my new Iteration

I was immediately drawn to the Armed after first hearing their music. Their albums contain the
same kind of energy and musicality I’ve been working for years to create, to feel, to express. I
obsess over music I love, to the point I’ll read every piece of information I can about it and its
process to further love it more. The Armed is the perfect outlet for that because of the depth of
their creativity/mystery and the community surrounding them, and what has drawn the biggest
and most transformative emotional response from me has been watching Daniel Greene (Naud)
transform and evolve over the course of the video material.

On my first impression (paradise day), I already relate to Dan so much. He is intelligent and an
observer, he carries himself humbly, and he is distracted with something in his mind that’s
pulling his attention away from the everyday drudge of his modern life. I can feel his
desperation to break out, and even his body language suggest to me that he’s terribly
uncomfortable in his own skin. I relate to all of that so deeply though I admit there is probably
plenty of projection from me onto the character.

From then on, I watch this iteration of Daniel in each piece of media as he transforms, changes,
and evolves into something even more different than before. There are spells of sorrow, near
insanity, impossible loneliness and paranoia. And as he moves through it all he seems to be
becoming stronger, his will to express what’s inside of him is growing over his fear of doing it.
I’m afraid for him, joyful watching him dance and sing, and when I see that there are two of him
in some shots, I start to realize he is separating his former self from his new iteration, becoming
something entirely new.
In the Masonic film, in his conversation with Gold Jade we see Daniel at an impasse, curious if
any of what he’s experienced thus far was/is “real” or meant to be. I relate this to the existential
crisis and mental breakdown I was having at the time I saw this. He is almost afraid of what’s
coming, knowing this transformation and release will forever change his existence. Then he
says something that has never left my mind since I heard it: “There’s a point amidst the haze
where you can’t see any further in. But you can’t see out either.” When we’re caught in
something, be it pain or happiness, it’s overwhelming power can blind us, or confuse our
spiritual senses and cause us to shrink and run, or forget why we’re there in the first place.
Losing my father and only remaining birth parent in February of ‘22 was a giant traumatic event
for me. Burying my estranged birth mother years 9 years prior had led me into alcoholism and
suicidal ideation, and eventually I had recovered and became sober while married to my ex
wife. Dad and I were extremely close, open and vulnerable with one another. During my
sobriety his encouragement carried me through.

After his death, my wife walked out on me 3 months later. Our relationship had become stale,
full of contradiction and hypocrisy as well as emotional abuse and manipulation. Our marriage
and relationship wasn’t perfect, but it was the inspiration for my continuing to move forward. I
had completely lost my sense of self love and respect, and nearly ended up on the streets after
our separation.

The Armed fell into my path right after all this occurred. Seeing Dan Greene was like looking
directly into a broken mirror. And the music and lyrics of the band fit perfectly into the context
of my life lived, like a missing puzzle piece. Then I found the community of fans who all take on
the name of Dan Greene to signify their love for the ideas and identity of the band and its
creator/s, who understand and respect the philosophy that we own nothing, the things we
think we need we don’t, and we each have unlimited freedom, power and strength in the
pursuit of creativity and pure expression.

Now I know many Dan Greenes. And they are the most unique, diverse, loving and accepting
group I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting. Dan’s journey, The Armed’s music, and this
community of likeminded individuals is one of the most inspiring and rewarding things I think
I’ve ever been a part of, both in heart and mind. They showed me that no matter how lost or
hurt you are, you’re never where you have to be.
