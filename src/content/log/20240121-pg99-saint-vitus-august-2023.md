thanks to my friend [Rachel](https://rachelisaweso.me/) for being on the waitlist and getting tickets! I didn't get to see them during their [original run 25 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEgWTm2Ynjk) or any of the previous reunions, glad to catch them this time.

love they crammed 9 performers on the stage, and great work sound engineer getting this many instruments sounding anywhere near coherent.

pretty sure I recognized an old coworker from like 6 years ago, but by the time I was like "yeah that's definitely him" too much time passed and I felt awkward. hi Tommi, sorry I didn't say anything!

also rad to see Thom/[Planning For Burial](https://planningforburial.bandcamp.com/) at the show, sorry I kept getting slammed into you.

middle of August, this show was _hot_, the room was **sweaty**. always feels just a little extra gross when glasses are fogged up from sweat vapor ♨️
