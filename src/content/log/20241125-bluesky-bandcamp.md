<a href="/bsky-bc"><img src='/assets/20241125-bsky-bc.webp' height=600 alt="screenshot of the web app. the main body of the app is a grid of album covers. one of those is active with a play button. there's a floating header showing the album title and tags: softscars, by yeule, and the tags: electronic, ambient, glitch, indie rock, pop. it's a great album btw, you should listen to it. also in the floating header are two inputs: filter by tags, filter by title. also, if you're reading this, i'm sorry the app is not more keyboard accessible: everything i can control is, but once the bandcamp embed loads, i can't control anything in there. i hope it works okay."></a>

i built this thing that helps me discover new music and maybe you'll like it too! [bsky-bc](/bsky-bc). this is already a bad name because i plan to add [Ampwall](https://ampwall.com/) support soon.

this annoys me but i'm gonna leave it for now so i can eventually write an "`x` is now `y`" post and also I have `bsky-bc` hardcoded in a bunch of places and i don't want to stop writing this post to go fix it, sorry!!!

aside: i want more bands and musicians to use text-oriented social media. i reluctantly got back on instagram recently because that's where the bands (and tattoo artists) are, but i really don't like being on there. shoutout [Chat Pile](https://bsky.app/profile/chatpileband.bsky.social)  for being a real poster.

anyway i'm having a lot of fun on bluesky in general, but i really love an open firehose of posts to build on again. 

there are some good feeds aggregating bandcamp links:  [Skramz/Hardcord/Crust BC](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bq64f3juf7ntmvnu34caveo4/feed/aaacbrxni6bre),  [Bandcamp Links](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bfpmfv5ydp5zzeoe2ys6q7p6/feed/aaapfkuhnemku), and [Metal Bandcamp](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zl44mnon7eylu26m3zoonf4x/feed/aaaobv3jytrp4) are the ones I have pinned. made me want to look into building my own feed generator, so i forked [feed-generator](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator) and saw these lines [subscription.ts](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator/blob/main/src/subscription.ts#L13-L18):

```typescript
// This logs the text of every post off the firehose.
// Just for fun :)
// Delete before actually using
for (const post of ops.posts.creates) {
  console.log(post.record.text)
}
```

sorry, comment: I deleted all the other lines and kept this line and filtered for posts containing bandcamp links, spit those out to the console as `jsonl`. figured that would let me `tee` the file so I could replay the stream later. this has worked out great.

once i got that first `posts.jsonl` file i got distracted from the feed generator and started playing with it to do other stuff. 

## browsers are rad
üèÜ mvps üèÜ
1. if you simply don't do anything it's responsive out of the box
    - threw a bunch of images right up next to each other and it worked great[^1]
        - easy when the "design" is just a big grid of images, but in general it's rad that the browser is just designed this way by default.
2. `<img loading=lazy>`
    - important enough i would have implemented this if i had to, but i didn't have to!
    - between intentionally using low-res album art and using `loading=lazy` i get solid performance on slow 4G.
        - ultimately this is for streaming music, figure slow 4G is a good enough lower bound
3. `<datalist>`
    - autocomplete without js![^2] 
    - don't love calculating & debugging element positioning so if this wasn't here i probably wouldn't have had suggested completions at all, or at least not in the first version
        - suppose i could use a strict dropdown but i want to be able to type "metal" and get all the metals
4. `[attribute*=selector]`
    - filtering creates `:not([data-tags*=search-term])` style to hide everything that doesn't match.

## firehose too powerful
i could rent a VPS but i've got this perfectly good NAS sitting here mostly idle, why not put it to work? i tossed the script on there and ran it in `tmux`. at this point, all it did was generate `posts.jsonl`. i would `scp` that down and run the rest of the pipeline to generate the page:

- filter to those containing _album_ or _track_ urls.
    - might do stuff with the other ones later, but starting with just those
- get html from each url
    - cache the response so i don't keep hitting bandcamp when i fuck something up and need to run it again
- pull out the title, tags, and album/track ID using `cheerio`
    - eventually started caching the result of this, too, it's a somewhat expensive operation
- save as a `.js` file that defines album data
- manually copy that to cloud storage

this was fine except it required me to manually do stuff which is horrible but i convinced myself it's good enough because i'm trying to fight against my impulse to hold things back until they are ‚ú®perfect‚ú®

before fixing that I needed to do something because the way consumed the firehose was melting my NAS‚Äîit couldn't keep up with the firehose and was consistently dropping posts. it's not a very powerful machine.

## jetstream just right
figured that since i'm not generating feeds, maybe forking off `feed-generator` is not the optimal move. looked into the [bluesky jetstream](https://docs.bsky.app/blog/jetstream), switched over to [@skyware/jetstream](https://skyware.js.org/guides/jetstream/introduction/getting-started/) and it both greatly simplified things and fixed the performance issues.

seriously the whole watcher is 25 lines
```ts
import { Jetstream } from "@skyware/jetstream";
import WebSocket from "ws";

const jetstream = new Jetstream({
  ws: WebSocket,
  wantedCollections: ["app.bsky.feed.post"],
});

jetstream.onCreate("app.bsky.feed.post", (event) => {
  const post = event.commit;

  for (const facet of post.record.facets ?? []) {
    for (const feature of facet.features ?? []) {
      if (feature.$type !== "app.bsky.richtext.facet#link") {
        continue;
      }
      if (feature.uri.match(/(\.bandcamp\.com\/)|(\/\/ampwall\.com\/)/)) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify({ ...post, did: event.did }));
        break;
      }
    }
  }
});

jetstream.start();
```

## an iteration ([·õû](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtfqR3tTMB8))
here's the current web-scale version

```bash
IN=posts.jsonl
OUT=album-data.js
watcher | tee -a $IN | cleaner $IN | enricher | compiler $OUT
```

oh, and in another `tmux` window

```bash
op run sync-album-data album-data.js
```

- `watcher`: pull music posts off the jetstream
    - keeping all `bandcamp.com` and `ampwall.com` links
    - can't do anything with `ampwall` links yet, but want them for the future
- `cleaner`:  filter down to `bandcamp.com/(album|track)`, throw out most of the post data since we're not using it for anything yet
    - stream `$IN` before streaming from `stdin`
- `enricher`: go off to bandcamp and pull the album/track information
    - throw out any unexpected results (404s, missing images or weird pages)
    - caches http responses and parsing results
- `compiler`: de-duplicates and compiles the stream down to `album-data.js`
- `sync-album-data`: copies `album-data.js` to my cloud storage in a `while true` with a `sleep 120`
    - `op` is the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/), I use it for secrets injection, which i should write a whole 'nother post about because it's neat

breaking it up this way made things pretty easy to test different parts with both canned and live input. i'm using `esbuild` to create standalone bundles for each of the stages and i have a script that copies them to the NAS. eventually i'll do something smarter, but it's _fine for now_.

using [stromjs](https://github.com/lewisdiamond/stromjs) makes building each stage pretty straightforward. this is the `main` function of `cleaner`:

```ts
function main() {
  const streamPrefix = process.argv[2];
  
  const cleaner = compose([
    jsonl(), //see appendex
    flatMap(extractMusicUris),
    stringify(),
    join("\n"),
  ]);

  let stream = process.stdin as Readable;
  if (prefix) {
    stream = merge(createReadStream(streamPrefix), process.stdin);
  }

  stream.pipe(cleaner).pipe(process.stdout);
}
```

there's certainly a lot of serializing and deserializing going on across the whole pipeline, but that's nowhere close to the bottleneck of this stream processor so it doesn't matter to me.

## what's next
- add ampwall support
    - it's the second sentence of this blog post! i am capturing those posts i'm just not doing anything with them yet
- opt-in to updates without having to reload the whole page
    - notify when there's a new set of albums and add those
- better spam protection
    - i dropped `did`s for a while on accident, but I have them back now so i can start ‚ùåing folks who are doing nothing but spamming links
- pagination of some sort
    - right now i'm just loading every fuckin thing that's ever been observed and that party is certainly not gonna last
    - thinking about different ways to do this without losing ability to search everything or having to introduce a server
- browser extension/userscript for bc/ampwall
    - send `postMessage`s from embed so I can get around cross origin protection and know when & what things are playing, which would let me add global player controls
- more performance optimizations
    - it's able to handle ~2000 albums pretty well even on slow 4G and 4x CPU throttling, but i always want to do better! been thinking about strategies for improving local caching and incremental updates to improve all loads after first

## appendix: jsonl

```ts
export function jsonl(): Compose {
  return compose([
    split("\n"),
    map((line: string) => line.trim()),
    filter((str) => !!str),
    parse(),
  ]);
}
```

[^1]: begrudgingly had to wrap each entry in a container element with `inline-block` eventually
[^2]: unfortunately broken on Firefox Mobile for Android. there's a [6 year old bug open for it](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1535985)
