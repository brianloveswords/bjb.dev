shoutout to Dave Rupert's [vibe checks](https://daverupert.com/2024/10/vibe-check-35/) for the inspiration

## üõ†Ô∏è desire to tinker: rising
- registered a new domain: brianlovewords.com
    - for my [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/brianloveswords.com) handle, nothing's there yet
        - might transfer my blog there eventually, use this domain for small projects or something
            - _after 301'ing everything!_
- finally got an RSS feed up in here!
    - more recent versions of Astro have a plugin for it
        - i was on 0.23 üò¨, updated to something respectable
- quick & hacky way to author in Obsidian
    - got my Obsidian set up _just right_ for writing stuff
    - don't want to stick a whole git repo into Obsidian
    - fuck it, just hard link
        - i always create files in Obsidian first
        - wrote a little script that links anything that's not linked yet

## ü¶∑ month 2 of invisalign
- first week sucked!
    - getting the attachments sucked
        - i didn't ask enough questions and they didn't explain enough
        - left a lot of extra teeth concrete or whatever, hated how my teeth felt after it
            - all the extra has since come off with attaching/detaching aligners and brushing
- do not regret getting a sonic cleaner
    - spent about a week brushing them by hand
        - it sucked
    - got a generic sonic cleaner off Amazon
        - _i gotta stop using Amazon_
        - hope this thing doesn't fall apart in a year
    - got Retainer Brite tablets
        - didn't know until now when I was looking it up, but their [website](https://theretainerbrite.com/) has entirely too many AI generated people
    - works great, way better than brushing manually
        - spouse also uses it for jewelry, so it's getting more use than i expected
- honestly, kinda like the routine it imposes
    - really making me cut down on my snacking
    - ‚Ä¶but it's been hard past few weeks when traveling for long all-day work events and I can't control my own eating schedule
- miss sipping tea all day
    - i used to make about 2 liters of tea in the morning and sip it all day, can't do that anymore

## üôÄ Japanese horror
- [Audition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audition_(1999_film)): loved the photography, great overall
- [One Missed Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Missed_Call_(2003_film)): Final Destination vibes, fine
- [Battle Royale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film)): interesting to watch the original!
- [Dark Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Water_(2002_film)): enjoyed the sound design[^1]
