### venue

- _1896 Studios_ | Brooklyn, NY

### notes

- saw **Deli Girls** open for **Black Eyes** last year
    - this time I only heard them, was all the way in the back
        - on purpose this time because back of the room was front row for LB since they set up on the floor opposite end of the stage
- been about 20 years since I saw **Lightning Bolt**!
    - first time being front row, jesus christ
        - my ribs were fucked up from NRF and it was a bad idea to be up front but holy shit what a blast
    - Bassist Brian said "when you get pushed forward, try to be careful of the pedals‚Ä¶but maybe the crowd won't push this time?"
        - _it was tidal wave of humans_
