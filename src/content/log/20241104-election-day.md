tomorrow is election day, a temporary reprieve from campaigns before the 2028 election season starts up in a week. I'm worried about what happens after the count more than the actual results.

for the top of the ticket, I'm voting Harris/Walz. not as progressive as I want—nobody at that level of politics is, likely not possible on the national level—but the choice is between [cowards and enemies](https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/how-to-think-about-politics-without). elections are checkpoint, not the endgame, and the ongoing work is to create the conditions for cowards to do the right thing.

moreover, I really want Trump to lose because...well, everything he stands for, but also it means Elon loses too, and that's a win-win. motherfucker ruined twitter and [can't even chant U-S-A](https://x.com/airbagged/status/1850698650826981599)[^1] right. anyway, join me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/brianloveswords.com).

in NYC we also have ballot proposals. following the lead of [Hell Gate](https://hellgatenyc.com/hell-gate-guide-to-six-ballot-propositions/) and [NYCLU](https://www.nyclu.org/commentary/op-ed-what-you-need-to-know-about-nys-ballot-proposals) i'm voting yes on 1, no on 2-6. the latter props are ways for the mayor to accrete more power, and that's the absolute last thing any of our mayors need, particularly the jabroni we got in office right now.

[^1]: i understand the irony of linking to a twitter post in a sentence where talking about how Elon ruined twitter, but hey it's my website i make the rules and it's fair to link to a post clowning on him.
