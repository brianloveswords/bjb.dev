  - loved them!
    - stoked to see them with **Agriculture** next month
  - listen to [I Forgot Everything](https://leya.bandcamp.com/album/i-forget-everything)
- **Uniform** blew me away
  - so good I'm mad at myself for waiting this long to see them
  - didn't anticipate sheer energy of their performance
    - vocalist is incredible
  - two drummers!
    - kept perfect time!!
      - seen multiple drummer setups not work well, this _worked_
  - two bassists!
    - pummeled by low end
  - gonna do the 2 bass/2 drums setup at [Roadburn 2025](https://roadburn.com/band/uniform/)
    - link points to the right page at time of writing
      - but the link doesn't have the date or festival edition in it
        - so if **Uniform** plays again in the future I imagine this page might be replaced.
