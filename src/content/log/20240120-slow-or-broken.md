I use [Songkick](https://www.songkick.com/) but I'm frustrated by how slow it is.

I figured I'd give [bandsintown](https://www.bandsintown.com/) a shot.

When it wasn't `403 Forbidden`ing, it was `504 Gateway Timeout`ing.

I found [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Concerts/comments/114xu60/songkick_vs_bandsintown/) saying their recommendations are worse and their subpar recommendations come as a lot of emails.

I went back to Songkick and I'm frustrated by how slow it is

I wish websites were good.
