when I was looking for music videos to add to my [`/music`](/music) page I found [this great channel of live shows from Saint Vitus](https://www.youtube.com/@MaxVolumeSilence). I wanted to start posting videos of live shows here anyway, so might as well start with one I was at!

if you want the full experience, there's videos of the openers, Lathe of Heaven[^1] and True Body. I enjoyed True Body a lot! I bought their latest album [_Temple of Song_](https://truebody.bandcamp.com/album/temple-of-song) after the show.

portrayal of guilt's drummer is so good, he's got some of most interesting playing in hardcore right now. I got there early so I could stand right up front and watch his playing, but that's the danger zone—that guy who jumped at the start of the second song kicked me _right_ in the fuckin head.

after that song finishes there's a cut in the video, the two guys behind me started fist fighting and spilled onto the stage (taking me with them) and the singer had to tell 'em to knock it the fuck off. after that I moved to a different spot which is fortunate for you because my fuzzy head isn't blocking the guitar in the rest of the shots.

I can't wait to see them again.
